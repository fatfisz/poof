# poof

> Data processing decorators

## Getting Started

Install the package with this command:
```shell
npm install poof --save
```

## What does it do

This lib enables you to create a function for processing data.
Every function processes data in some way, so it may sound like nothing special, and it probably isn't.
The main difference lies in how you declare what to do with data.

```js
```
